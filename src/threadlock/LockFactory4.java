/*
 * This class will need a declare method, which threads
 * and processes will use to declare what order they will
 * request resources in. This declare method will iterate through
 * the declare order, adding each contiguous pair of elements
 * (v,w) to the graph. afterwards, it will check to see if 
 * any cycles have been created. If any cycles have been
 * created, it will backtrack, removing these edges from
 * the graph, and then exit.
 * 
 * we just have one final component to discuss: how
 * do we detect a cycle? we can detect a cycle by doing
 * a depth first search through each connected component(i.e., each
 * connected part of the graph). Complex algorithms exist
 * to select all the connected components of a graph, but our
 * work in this problem does not require this degree of complexity
 * 
 * we know that if a cycle was created, one of our new edges
 * must be to blame. thus, as long as our depth first search 
 * touches all of these edges at some point, then we know
 * that we have fully searched for a cycle.
 *

 * we may do several depth first searches, but touchNodes
 * is only initialized once. we iterate until all the values
